---
With 18 years of experience in marketing and having recently completed a Web Development program at Digifab in March 2023, I am now a qualified web and app developer seeking new  projects. 
Equipped with front-end and back-end skills, I am eager to apply my expertise in a professional setting. 
As a dynamic, curious, and technology-passionate individual, I am ready to take on new challenges within a web development team.
